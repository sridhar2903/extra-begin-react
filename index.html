    <title>REACT INTRODUCTION</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>REACT FEATURES:</h1>
    <p>React uses Virtual Dom</p>
    <p>React uses JSX,javascript xml</p>
    <p>React  has react-native for building mobile applications</p>
    <p>React has a feature of Components and reusability of components</p>

    <h1>VIRTUAL DOM:</h1>
    <p>Virtual DOM is the representation  of DOM</p>
    <p>Virtual DOM has two copies:A COPY AND B COPY</p>
    <p>The changes are only updated in the B copy and then two copies are compared with the help of diffing operation,only the differences found out is applied to the Real DOM</p>
    <p>Thus instead of updating the entire page only the changes are being  updated in the UI</p>


    <h1>Differences between Functional and Class Components</h1>
    <p>Functional component is similar to javascript,which will return the JSX</p>
    <p>Class component has a render method inside it ,which will return the JSX</p>
    <p>In Functional component,the state can be updated with React hook 'useState'</p>
    <p>In Class component,the state can be updated with 'this.Setstate'</p>
 <h4>Functional Components are mostly preferred because react is a javascript library and so javacript is a functional programming language.</h4>
    
 <h1>What is single page application</h1>
 <p>Single page application does not use default method of loading new pages,instead it will update the current page with new data,this is what a Single Page Application means.</p>
 <p>Single Page Application is achieved through REACT ROUTING</p>
<h1>What is React Routing</h1>
<p>React Router is a library with the help of which we can achieve routing in react.</p>
<p>React Router library is categorized into two:react-router-dom:for web applications and react-router-native:for mobile applications.</p>
<p>Routing means moving from one page to  another page without reloading the application and thus making it a Single Page Application.</p>
<p>So in our App.js we have to wrap the components with browser router and we have following components in React Router:</p>
<p>Router:which will provide the routing paths</p>
<p>Routes :it is a container in which we have multiple routing paths,whichever is selected that particular component or page will be rendered </p>
<p>Route:corresponds to a single routing path and also a single component,there can be multiple route ,all enclosed  between Routes </p>
